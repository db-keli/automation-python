### String Literals
*typing quotation in quotaions*: 
<br>One benefit of using double quotes is that the string can have a single quote character in it.<br>
``` print("That is Alice's cat")```

*Escape characters*:
<br> An escape character lets you use characters that are otherwise impossible to put into a string. An escape character consists of a backslash (\) followed by the character you want to add to the string. (Despite consisting of two characters, it is commonly referred to as a singular escape character.) For example, the escape character for a single quote is \'. You can use this inside a string that begins and ends with single quotes.<br>
```>>> spam = 'Say hi to Bob\'s mother.'```
<br>Python knows that since the single quote in Bob\'s has a backslash, it is not a single quote meant to end the string value. The escape characters \' and \" let you put single quotes and double quotes inside your strings, respectively.<br>

*Escape Character* ------ *Prints*<br>
\'-------------------------Single quote<br>
\"-------------------------Double quote<br>
\t-------------------------Tab<br>
\n-------------------------Newline (line break)<br>
\\\\-----------------------Backslash<br>
